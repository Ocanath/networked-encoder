1. Break pads out to the encoder case for programming
2. instead of terminating fsr wires at current location, split another branch out at 90 degrees and wrap it to the top of the encoder case so the existing 
	wire guides/channel can be used; it just terminates the wires at a different location
3. add a branch somewhere for the temperature sensor

4. Do board to board connector for the aenc to the new 12mm motor encoder, like how in phones are done like yeah good
5. 7pin df52 exits 12mm motor encoder, and does df52 to pico-blade to hand. 7pin has 3.3, gnd, UART, cos, sin, SDA, SCL. SDA and SCL are normally unpopulated
6. for the fsr foldover, do a picolock that sits on the top of the drive train case as well as a solder version
